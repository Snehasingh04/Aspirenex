**Data Science Projects: Titanic Survival Rate & Iris Flower Classification**

This repository contains two data science projects: Titanic Survival Rate prediction and Iris Flower Classification. Both projects demonstrate the use of machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems.

**Titanic Survival Rate**
Project Description
The Titanic Survival Rate project aims to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, etc. We use machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle's Titanic dataset. It includes information about passengers like age, sex, class, and other attributes.

**Iris Flower Classification**
Project Description
The Iris Flower Classification project focuses on classifying iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their petal and sepal measurements. Machine learning algorithms are used to create a classification model.

Dataset
The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with 4 features each: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Dataset Source-Kaggle
